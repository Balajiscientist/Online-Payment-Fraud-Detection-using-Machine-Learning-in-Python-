# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-in-Python-
I‚Äôm thrilled to share my latest project on GitHub ‚Äì Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning! This project aims to enhance the security of online payments by using machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent activities in real-time.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used:
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Pandas & NumPy (for data preprocessing)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
google colab (for exploratory data analysis)
üìù Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed online payment transaction data.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to detect fraud.
Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model‚Äôs performance.
Future Scope: This model can be deployed in real-time payment systems to flag fraudulent transactions instantly.
